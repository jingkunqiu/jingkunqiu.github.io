Hi, there. I am Jingkun Qiu (丘竞昆), a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in Statistics at [Peking University](https://www.gsm.pku.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Professor [Song Xi Chen (陈松蹊)](https://www.songxichen.com) with the expected date of graduation June 2026.

From September 2017 to June 2021, I obtained a B.Sc. in Statistics at [Xiamen University](https://soe.xmu.edu.cn/).

My doctoral research focuses on limit theorems, high dimensional statistical inference, and statistical theory for climate change studies.

I am actively seeking a postdoctoral position in mathematical statistics and related fields. Any leads, information, and/or advice would be greatly appreciated.
